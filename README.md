# Flappy Bird
This is a complete recreation of the original Flappy Bird game. It was made using the Godot Engine. While the game uses the same assets as the original, all the game logic was programmed from scratch. The purpose of this beginner project is just to learn to get better at game development. This project is meant to resemble the original game as closely as possible. The original game was made by .Gears Studios in 2013.

## How to play (Android only)
Download the .apk file in the release section and then put it on your phone using something like Google Drive. Then open it on your phone and just run it. It will then install like any other app. Have fun!
